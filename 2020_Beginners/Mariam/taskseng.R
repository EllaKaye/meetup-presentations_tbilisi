# 1.1. First find out what your current working directory is
getwd()

# Now set a new working directory
setwd("/Users/MariamAsatiani/Documents/R")

# Using help() or ? functions figure out what the following functions do: paste(); abline(); c()

# 1.2. Create eight objects named var0, var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6, var7
# with the following content: 5, 2+2, 4*5, 240/60, 4^15, "this is", "my object", "5"

# 1.3. What is the difference between var0 and var7? 
#var0 is numeric var7 is a character

# 1.4. Do a summing operation with var0 and var3.

# 1.5. Paste var5 and var6 into one new object called "var56".

# 1.6. Using the function c() create a vector with the following elements: 1,2,3,4. 
#name it a

# Using the function c() create a vector with the following elements: 1,1,1,1. 
# name it b

# Using the function length() find out what is the length of a.

# Sum a and b vectors and create a new vector c

# Using the function isTRUE() and the operator == find out if a and b vectors are equal

# Create a new vector v. Should include "hi", "hello", "hola" 

# Using the function class(), find out what the classes of vectors a and v are. 

# 1.7 Create a matrix
##M1 <- matrix(c(1,1,2,2,3,3), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

# 1.8. Install and load the following packages: foreign, readr, readstata13.

# 1.9. Read about these packages - what are they for?

# 1.10. Save your R file in your working directory.
